Question 5

Define a class to overload the function print as follows:

void print(): Prints the following format:

1 1 1 1  
2 2 2 2  
3 3 3 3  
4 4 4 4  
5 5 5 5

void print(int n): Checks whether the number is a lead number. 
A lead number is one whose sum of even digits equals the sum of odd digits. 
For example:

Input: 3669

Odd digits sum = 3 + 9 = 12

Even digits sum = 6 + 6 = 12

Output: 3669 is a lead number.
